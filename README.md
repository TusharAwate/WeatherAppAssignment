# WeatherAppAssignment

This app gets accurate weather forecast information available for the next five days.

I have developed this project as assignment on ReactJS framework.

This is the weather widget app implemented with React and Redux.

This widget shows the current weather at the top, forecast by day in the middle and forecast by dates at the bottom.

At this moment weather forcast data for London is shown by default. Search funcationality can be added in future.


Click on different date tile to show forecast by day related to this date.

Click on degrees units at the top tile to change degrees units.
